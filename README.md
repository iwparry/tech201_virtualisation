# DevOps and Development Environments

## DevOps - Notes

### What is DevOps?
Key aspects of DevOps include breaking the silos that keep Developer and Operations teams apart in order
to improve collaboration, share responsibilities, deploy infastructure as code

benefits include: improved collaboration, get product out quicker


### What we want our tools to be
- Easy to use - other teams use the tools we create, they won't do so if they aren't user firendly
- Flexible - everything the company uses should be easily updated as the business need changes
- Robust - need close to 100% uptime as possible for our company's services
- Cost - cost is often overlooked, we need to ensure the company is being as efficient as possible in its tech dealings

#### Why its important
- Ease of use - if devs don't use our tools, there will be headache/delays later down the line
- Flexibility - it can be easy to get locked into using a specific product, tool or software and it then becomes hard for a company to keep with industry changes
- Robustness - We are responsible for achieving this as DevOps Engineers
- Cost - e.g. How powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task? Do we need certain servers running? etc.

#### Two tier 
In a two-tier architecture, the client os on the first tier. The database server and web appliction server reside on the same server machine which is the second tier
#### Microservices
